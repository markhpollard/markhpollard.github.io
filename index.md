Here’s how to get good at strategy: words. Start with words, continue with words, and finish with words. You have one job - get good at words.

Why? At some point, everything is words. If you can see it, it’s words. If you can think it, it’s words. If you can feel it, it’s words. 

You live in a world of your own making and you use words to sustain it because you see the world through the words you’ve used to create it. Like everyone else, you choose the meaning of these words because their meaning keeps your world’s meaning alive. However, a word you use everyday means something else to someone else somewhere else because that’s how that someone keeps their world alive. 

Yes, words make worlds but words can do much more - words can do anything. A novel’s words can take us into someone else’s life. Two words can seal a promise. Words can start and end marriages, deals, and wars. One word can forever follow a newborn. A magic word can help a child get what she needs. Final words can give peace to a life as it ends. 

You can use words as maps, torches, and breadcrumbs. You can use words as fireworks, tickles, and peace. You can locate yourself with words, build projects with words, stand a career on words, and expose ideas good and bad with words. 

When you do strategy, you try to find meaning in and make meaning from mess, and words do this for you. Research is a hunt for words - you can watch and count but, at some point, you’ll use words to guide and then explain your hunt. An insight updates how you see the world - it gives you words that introduce you to something magnificent that you never knew existed or it gives you new words for something you knew existed but with magnified meaning. A creative brief is an attempt to capture only the most important words - an act of bravery. A presentation is a long set of words that gets you to the creative brief. An idea happens in words. Words can do anything but they’ll help you most to find and make meaning.

People say actions speak louder than words but words act louder than actions because they have the last word. Words not only lead to action, they then tell the story of those actions years after the actions have happened. Words are the brains and memories of actions.

However, words aren’t easy. Words will blunder and stumble their ways through you then plop into the world hoping you can teach them to walk. It might take many words to draw you to one perfect word. And, sometimes, words will take a leave of absence from you altogether. Either way, words get you clear and clarity makes you move.

If you think word length impresses people, if you think education earns you more syllables, if you think presentations are better with more slides, understand this: big words are hiding places and good strategy doesn’t hide. Good strategy exposes and it uses words with bite to reveal itself.

You can say words don’t matter but you’d use words to make the point. 

In strategy, words are all that matters. 

Strategy is your words.
