summary: Freelancing strategy sounds cool. But is it really what you need to do right
  now?
---



Freelancing strategy sounds cool. It can give you a break from a toxic work life, help you meet new companies, and give you back your life, but it can also keep you in a sexy limbo that can prevent you from doing the harder work of examining what you really want in life and how you'll go about it making it happen.

Here are sixteen thing to contemplate before and as you freelance.

**1. Work out why you want to freelance**

There are at least five reasons people freelance:
A. “I don’t like being an employee.”
 B. “I have to until I get a job.” 
C. “I feel disillusioned and want some time out.” 
D. "I want more time for other things.” 
E. “It sounds cool.”

Be clear or use each interaction with a potential hirer to get clear on why you want to freelance.

**2. Consider for how long you’ll freelance**

There are at least six time horizons:
 A. "Until I like a company"
 B. "Until I get a job offer "
C. "Until the economy recovers "
D. "Until I work out what I want in life "
E. "Indefinitely" 
F. "For life"

Knowing this will help you make decisions from a place that honors you.

**3. Work out how much money  you need over what time**

This might seem obtuse and difficult  but there are rules of thumb.  For instance, some people set out  to earn enough money to only require  about 5% of it per year to live on.   

This might be a long journey for you  but it helps to be clear on the journey.

**4. Revisit your attitude towards  materialism, wealth, and spending**

It’s easier to do this as you become clear about why and for how long  you want to freelance.  You might need months of savings and really low expenses during difficult times. 

It’s not that these need to be in place before you freelance and, then, at all times,  but it’s something to work towards.

**5. Think about whether freelancing is  really solving the problem you want to solve**

Unless you have a big network, reputation, and commercial nous, freelancing can feel like being an employee but with less impact. It’s common to see people alternate between full-time roles and freelancing because they want to feel more authority in making good work happen rather than just coming in and leaving at a reasonable hour. What’s your mood?

**6. Consider whether  you’re putting yourself into limbo**

Freelancing can seem cool  but it can put you into limbo,  where you’ll bounce between contracts  and phases without work.  Challenge yourself to think about  what’s attracting you to it and  whether you’re avoiding more difficult decisions or challenges that scare you.

**7. Work out what you do  and for how much**

Grab a piece of paper and write down  your philosophy, process, and  three packages with prices.  This is for your eyes only.  It will help you work out what you’re about and what you think it’s worth.  It will also help you judge opportunities.

**8. Pricing and payment can take many shapes**

A. Benchmarked hourly rate - ask around
 B. Company tells you what they’ll pay 
C. Project or value-based rate -  a flat fee or % based on what you think the work is worth
 E. You make up a number that scares you 
F. Day or weekly rate - work out how much money you want to earn per year and how many days a year you’ll work then arrive at a day rate.

How you price yourself will depend on
* Why you’re freelancing, 
* Your money needs, 
* Your reputation,
* Your ability to know your market value,
* Your interest in advocating for yourself, and 
* Your ability to discuss money and value.

Be clear on payment terms.  Ask for some money up front. Treat each project as a way to learn.

**9. Document and manage your scope**

Most companies will push you  through their systems - procurement,  NDA, Master Services Agreement (MSA),  Scope of Work (SOW), invoicing, and timesheets.

You’ll need to manage your scope,  review agreements, and  advocate for your payment terms. 

 You can try to charge money or provide discounts depending on payment schedules and whose documents you use.

**10. Company systems exist to  dumb down everything**

You don’t need to accept anything. 
You don’t have to sell hours.  
You don’t have to do timesheets.
 You don’t have to agree to wait  three months before payment. 

If it becomes a deal-breaker,  then you have a decision to make -  how badly do you want the work?

**11. Set up a company if you see yourself freelancing for several years**

A company is a useful legal  and tax instrument.  It can also help you look bigger  than what you are and  give you a way to get distance from yourself  if you start to take business too personally.

**12. Build your name and vibe**

Selling strategy can take time.  Chances are someone will know you  or they’ll have heard of you over the years. They’ll keep an eye on you.  Then an opportunity will arise  and it might take weeks to months  to go from the initial contact  to meetings and scopes. 

If you have a presence and reputation,  two things can happen:
A. You’ll attract people who want  what you do and how you do it
 B. You’ll attract people who’ll take care  of you within their systems 
E.G. They’ll explain things to procurement.

 Clients who act like allies  within their own systems  are beautiful humans.  Treat them well.

**13. Don’t fear taking the lead**

Buying and selling strategy  is an ambiguous affair.  

Let someone tell you what they want  but search for the problem they want to solve and then tell them  how you think you can get to the solution.

 This means changing conversations from “We need a planner for two weeks” to  “This is how I can help solve your problem.”

**14. Embrace selling**

You might get repeat clients  but chances are you’ll often need new clients.  So stay active in public.  Negotiate credit for your work and  whether you can show it in public.  If you can’t then this reduces your value and you might want to increase fees.

 Selling and negotiating make freelance life happen so try to enjoy them.

**15. Launch strong and stay front-of-mind**

There are no right or wrong ways  to launch yourself as a freelancer  but don’t underestimate launching strong - have a solid website, a good social presence, an email list, and clear ways of working.   Create something worth sharing.  There’s a buzz you’ll get a few shots at over the years but launching well is important.  Then stay in public.

**16. Keep an eye on fantasies and flattery**

“I’m going to set up a collective.” 
“All these people want coffees.” 
“Yes, you can pick my brain.” 

These are common distractions.  Remember, a lot of successful business people see other people as something  to operate or to extract from.  Have a focus, an intention for  what you want to do in life. It will help you work out what to say “Yes” to.
