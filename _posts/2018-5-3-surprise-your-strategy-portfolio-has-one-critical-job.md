Portfolios aren’t difficult. The Terrible Twos are difficult. The Terrible Twos are the third year of our lives, a year in which we become hooligans in the home, a state to which we all no doubt return decades later. No, portfolios aren’t like this — portfolios are dainty.

![You Can't Get It Wrong](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*33aEmA9Ulpola0LxD6DjOA.jpeg "Logo Title Text 1")

Flower arrangements are dainty. You diagnose your mood and creative appetite, you peruse your flower shop, then you select, cut, and arrange, and make someone happy or less sad. This is also what a portfolio must do.

Like planning, you can’t really get a portfolio wrong but you can get it dull. A dull portfolio contains boring work, long words, and it looks like it was made simply because that’s the thing one does nowadays, isn’t it?

For a second, let’s try empathy. Assuming you make your way through the young recruiters who may or may not know much about what you do or want to do but they know they have a seat to fill, the person reviewing your portfolio online or in person has probably contemplated and contributed to hundreds of projects. Your portfolio needs to smell like one of these. If you’re new to the industry and you’re applying to a place that is good at planning (and there are many places with planners that don’t do much planning), you have this riddle to solve:

1. **You need to look legit.** You need to look like you have a sense of the history of your industry, the basic language and concepts, a way with research, and a way with words.

2. **You need to look like you have a brain and your brain needs to look like it has an edge.** It needs to look like there is something sexy and unpredictable going on in there.

3. **You need to look bigger than your CV.** Everyone has a CV. Most people have a portfolio. How can you look bigger? How can you weave in other things in which you’re an original gangster? The rest of you.

The lazy way to do a portfolio is to treat it like a high school assignment, where you get a bunch of your work, and write about it without giving a shit about the person reading it. Blah blah blah

## A lazy case study does this:
1. It features a boring, shallow definition of the problem (or takes the original problem at face value or talks about awareness or relevance issues as the things to solve)
2. It lumbers from one long word to another with generic statistics thrown in
3. It shows boring work
4. It generally lacks a point of view

## A solid case study will cover these things:
1. The brief as we received it
2. The research we did
3. How we re-framed the brief
4. A sharpened or different audience definition
5. The problem we identified and proof it was the problem
6. An insight that shed new light on the problem
7. A new way of thinking about the competition or culture
8. A new way of thinking about the product or brand
9. The work the brief inspired
10. Whether the work worked

Yes, there’s room for a lot of other information but you want to be able to get the guts of the story across quickly — let’s say, in a minute or less (or 200 words or less).

Yes, you need to consider what you’ll do if your work was good but it didn’t lead to creative work, if confidentiality will get in the way, if what you did was a standalone strategy deliverable.

However, don’t forget your real challenge: to get and keep the attention and memory of the people reading your portfolio. Like flower arrangements, your job is to make this person happy or less sad, or maybe even jealous.

What you’re trying to do is poke them in their brains, to make them think, “Whoa, I didn’t see that coming,” to give them a sense of intellectual danger, to want you, to want to go into battle next to you.

It’s primal.

And if you share your portfolio with a planner who doesn’t want this, then good luck doing good planning with them. I’m sure all your presentations will be tidy and full of bullet points and highly agreeable unlike you when you were in your Terrible Twos.
