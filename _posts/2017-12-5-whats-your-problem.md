The word “problem” is a good word. However, some people don’t like this word — they don’t like to use it, and they don’t like other people using it. People who don’t like other people using this word call themselves “Optimists” and they believe that anyone who uses the word “problem” is sad, depressed, and suicidal. These people say: “We don’t have a problem; we have an opportunity.” And they usually cut you off mid-sentence to make a stand for positivity and to make sure you know that you can’t get away with thinking… well, anything.

Yeah. Cool.

But.

Imagine this:
1. You use the word “problem”,
2. You identify a really provocative problem that you need to solve, and then
3. You solve it

Isn’t that more optimistic than just calling yourself an optimist and pretending everything is opportunity?

Most people who refer to themselves as optimists out loud tend to lack depth, candour, and curiosity. Referring to yourself as an “optimist” in conversation seems to alleviate you from the need to think things through because… well, everything will just work out, right? Because “optimism” is magic and anything that isn’t optimistic is negative and destructive and peculiar, and optimists don’t allow peculiar things into their lives.

Cynicism, sarcasm, using rude words, holding two opposing ideas in your head at once, and identifying your obstacles are all intelligent and honest things to do. There’s research on it. Google it.

A well-stated problem will captivate your team. “Men have a violence issue” is a much more compelling problem to solve than this: “Our opportunity is to empower men to be the best version of themselves.” Seriously, take responsibility for your words and don’t use shit words.

But then, have a few techniques to help you see a problem from different angles. The easiest one is to ask “Why?” a lot. You’ve heard it before.

“Men have a violence issue”. OK, why?
Because they have to turn off their emotions at a young age
Because they grow up having to physically prove themselves
Because their dads — if they were in the household — didn’t model positive emotions

Because everything is physical when you’re a man
Because they don’t get told off when they fight when they’re young
Because they play too many video games and listen to rap music
Because they need a physical outlet but society’s ideas of what’s ok change over time

Because of evolution and biology

As a creative thinker, you then need to decide which of these problems is the real problem, not just a symptom, and in a way that you (or your client) has fair play at trying to solve. Then you try to solve it through an insight. And that’s where the optimism happens. However, this whole thing is optimistic because you’re able to look at a situation from many angles, in a disinterested way, and to then work out what to do. You don’t just gloss over everything because it’s uncomfortable or because someone tried to play the “It’s an opportunity” trump card in a meeting. Bullshit.
A few years ago, I interviewed the Dollar Shave Club CEO Michael Dubin. I asked him about the word “problem”. He said, “You don’t have to call it a problem but, when you do, it’s a more active indictment of a situation than calling it a need you’re solving.”
What’s your problem?

You better have one because you’ll do better with one.
