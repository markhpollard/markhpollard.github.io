## Ideas are your oxygen

If you studied accounting, you’d leave your first week knowing what the concepts “debit” and “credit” are. And, if you entered the career of accounting, you could only do so with intimate knowledge of these two concepts.

Unfortunately, people can enter advertising and marketing careers without ever knowing what an idea is, how to define what the word “idea” means, how to have ideas, or how to explain an idea once they have one in hand. Some people can sustain a long career through the brute force of their personality alone and by playing a game of, “Well, if we all don’t know then who’s to know?”

If you do creative work or have a creative soul, then ideas are your oxygen. This article just wants you to breathe. In it, I cover:

* The differences between ideas and thoughts

* The types of ideas we encounter in advertising

* How strategy and ideas work together and how they’re different

* Simple techniques to help you explain an idea

This article goes great with [How to do account planning - a simple approach](/how-to-do-account-planning-a-simple-approach/). If you do creative work, these two articles will catch you up to speed with concepts that took many years for many of us to comprehend.

## What’s an idea?

Words often get in the way of creativity so it’s no surprise that the word “idea” often gets in the way of ideas.

**1. We use the word “idea” to describe thoughts and suggestions -** “I know this is heteronormative of me but I have an idea: let’s eat kimchi soondubu at Food Gallery 32 in Koreatown for lunch.”

**2. We use the word “idea” to describe new concepts -** “I have an idea  —  it’s a business where we turn memes into bath products .  Dank Tank.”

**3. We use the word “idea” when someone says something stupid -** “You have no idea.” That’s a mean use of the word. Don’t be mean. The world doesn’t need it.

Now, if we focus on the first two examples, the word “idea” telegraphs that something new is coming. And if you can pause on your Internet memes about whether anything is ever new ( I’ll raise you post-modernism and ask if anything is ever real), what we now want to do is distinguish between the way we use “idea” as industry jargon and the way we use “idea” where we’re in casual mode.

**Ideas are thoughts but not all thoughts are “ideas”**

Here’s an example of the use of the word “idea” in an agency setting:
“I have an idea — let’s do something with augmented reality or Blockchain or make a special lens.” This isn’t wrong; it’s just sloppy.

In the traditional industry sense, “idea” means a novel concept. But when it’s used as in this example, it masks the lack of an actual idea  —  like when someone dumps in the word “strategic” before they say something that’s not strategic. It ups the importance of what comes next. The problem: sometimes this (as a meeting tactic) works but does not lead to good or clear thinking.

Compare this thought with the use of the word “idea” as a novel concept: “I have an idea  —  I want to create a tool that runners can use to track how far they’ve run and then compete with each other by sharing their achievements via the Internet. They’ll track it via this technology in their shoe which will talk to their computer.

**“Idea” and thought feel different**
When I’m training people in lateral thinking, I point out how adding mischief feels different in the brain. However, see how the two “I have an idea” statements above feel different? One is a yawn, the other a kick in the pants.

Yes, it’s complicated because humans complicate things. And what complicates all of this is that, as far as “ideas as novel concepts” go, in agency world, there are:
* Business ideas
* Advertising ideas
* Brand ideas
* Campaign ideas
* Content ideas
* New product ideas

Oh, and strategies (which are also ideas  —  even though the monopoly on the use of the word “idea” in an agency typically belongs to the creative department).

Perhaps, we need a different vocabulary to eliminate confusion and buffering or we simply need to define our words in public so we all know what we mean when we use them.
