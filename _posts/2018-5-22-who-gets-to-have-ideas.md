summary: "If we’re all creative, why do only some people get to say they are creative?"

“As a creative.” What does this mean? And why is it such a verbal tick for some people, a phrase that comes as automatically as “Um”?
Perhaps the phrase is an attempt to relate to others in a poignant and personal way, in a way that tries to summarize a life-long wrestle with identity and repression and denial, in a way that suggests enlightenment and a desire to soothe the quiet panic in the meeting at the time.
Perhaps.
Mostly, however, “as a creative” is an attempt to re-establish the rules of the game and that game is this: “Who gets to have ideas!”

When someone says they are “a creative,” they are trying to signal difference. These words say, “You are not creative or exceptional and couldn’t possibly understand.” And, yes, this might carry truth but the objective is to remind the listener that the say-er knows the game and is in control of the game and the listener needs to comply.

“As a creative” tries to shortcut critical thinking about creativity and creativity in agencies. So, let’s tear apart the shortcut:

All humans are innately creative (and destructive).
Some humans are better at certain types of creativity.
Creativity is the act of having ideas.
Ideas are useful combinations of things that don’t usually belong together.
Creativity is uncertainty attempting certainty.
Ideas and insights, if accepted, update our worlds and become new norms.

An idea can come from anywhere; some people are better at this.
Getting better requires techniques, practice, and traveling to the edge of your domain.

Getting better seems to also require certain personality traits.
Ideas can emerge over time or quickly strike; insights smell like ideas and do likewise.

Unfortunately, people who try to monopolize the idea of who gets to be creative do so to diminish — not magnify — others, and they do this with a lot of silent words and embedded meaning.

On one hand, this makes sense because it seems everyone thinks they are strategic and creative these days and, because they think this, there appears to be less respect for people who are exceptional at these things unless they are Beyonce. “As a creative” is an attempt to counter this.

On the same hand, many people who try to open creativity to everyone can misuse the phrase “Everybody is creative” when they:
 — Don’t teach people what creativity is,
 — Don’t give them tools, techniques, or time to do it, and
 — Outsource the act to a large, unstructured brainstorm
“Everybody is creative” then becomes an excuse for “cheap and fast.” If everybody can do it, then anybody can do it, so why pay more for people who are better at it?

On the other hand, wouldn’t we want agencies flooded with creative people? People who think of new and better ways to manage a project, on-board a client, manage a team, approach a pitch, structure remuneration, or present analytics?

Here’s the thing: every person in an agency needs to find their creative zest and apply it to their discipline. (Zombies need not apply.) And for this reason, real creative leadership leads a company, not a department.
Producers and account managers are the frontline of ideas. When someone reduces them to “suits” or “paper pushers,” they do so to spite themselves. When a writer or art director calls a planner a “frustrated creative,” they are just projecting. A planner is creative. A planner’s job is ideas. When they’re frustrated, they’re just a frustrated planner.
In an agency, everyone must have ideas, different kinds of ideas, ideas that respect other people’s skill sets and ambitions but that also magnify them, not diminish them.

Who gets to have ideas? Everyone. And, “as a creative,” I’d be scared to work with people who thought otherwise.
