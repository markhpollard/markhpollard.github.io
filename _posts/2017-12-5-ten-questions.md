This is the time of year for reflection (also, depression — more on that here). But all the time is really the time for reflection. We just need the right questions to ask ourselves. Then we need to allow the answers to emerge. And then we need to allow space for our minds to sew things together.

These ten questions are questions I refer to a lot, whether helping a founder with brand strategy or a friend with life strategy (you can help raise money for mental health by buying this article as a postcard).

Truth be told. I’ve had one of my favourite years ever. I started answering these questions below and erecting boundaries around my answers and then making my answers a reality nobody could pry from me.

Each project I’ve done, each mental workout I’ve taught, each mind fart I’ve Tweeted or published has sharpened and pushed my answers and, yet, I keep asking these questions of myself.
I’m 40 next year and still working this stuff out. I’m close.
Life’s work > Work work.

So a quick breakdown:

1. **What are you doing when you come alive?**
Go through your memories, social posts, photos, journals, and think of times when you were flowing. What were you doing? Who was with you (if anyone)? What themes do you see? Think about your last 3 projects. Which parts of them did you really enjoy? Which parts didn’t you enjoy?

2. **What does the world ask of you?**
We all get feedback from the world. When I poke the ad industry in the eye or try to provide a useful way of doing something related to planning, the world seems to want more. Or it teases me into thinking that. But I’m not sure the world is ready for my ART KOALAS. (DOPE!)

3. **What is something you care and feel angry about?**
Use your anger. There can be great power in anger. I did Wing Chun Kung Fu for a bunch of years. My friend’s uncle was a gentleman called William Cheung. He was a senior student to Bruce Lee. He used to talk of controlled aggression. This is a useful concept. You don’t need to shy away from anger if you can use it. Just use it in a controlled way. Me? I feel anger about how the advertising industry treats people, inflates itself, and often doesn’t train anyone. So I do training sessions and write about it.

4. **What do you know that your customers don’t know that would change their lives?**
Sometimes, marketers answer this question like this: “They don’t know about our product and our product would change their lives.” That’s not what this question is trying to get at. The CEO of Poo-Pourri Suzy Batiz says, “You know what’s funny? How, when we go to the toilet, we sit in someone else’s stench and then spray the room before we leave it.” BOOM! Insight.

5. **What can you do that others can’t?**

6. **What do you do that others don’t?**
These two are similar and require you to talk yourself up. You might list a few thoughts then let them linger and see a deeper pattern. Not to be 110% obnoxious but I think I get to newish thinking pretty quickly, I like writing slightly absurdist strategy stories, I like to draw, I think I’m OK at coaching people while I’m doing what I do (when I work with people it matters to me that they learn how to do what I do — not everyone is like that), and, because I write a lot, I try to get to strategy thoughts that aren’t stuck too far up themselves and can easily translate into content.

7. **If you designed a good day, what are you doing, where, and with whom?**
This is straight-forward but requires you to go beyond what you think you’re allowed to think. Three-hour walks around Central Park, yoga, Koreatown for kimchi soondubu, a flat white, reading a good book, strange conversations, watching stand-up comedy, doing silly drawings, chatting with my kids, traveling, listening to a mind-altering podcast, writing, learning, teaching. More than half of those things are part of my practice (a pretentious word for “how I work”).

8. **What do you want?**
A lot of us aren’t good at answering this, especially those of us on the introverted and excessively empathetic spectrum of things and in a world that seeks our obedience. I want to do intellectually stimulating work with people and companies I believe in and without having to follow much orthodoxy.

9. **What is in your way?**
I’m a big fan of cynicism, sarcasm, and negativity. There is research on these things — some of it suggests that they are useful thinking tools, even if you identify as being an optimist. One could argue, that being cynical and then using your cynicism to get to new ideas is the height of optimism. So, think about your obstacles — there are ideas in them.

10. **What do you need to make it happen? What is your first step?**
And now you get to work.

You don’t have to rush answers. You do need to practice listening to yourself.
