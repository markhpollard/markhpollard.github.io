## Ideas are your oxygen

If you studied accounting, you’d leave your first week knowing what the concepts “debit” and “credit” are. And, if you entered the career of accounting, you could only do so with intimate knowledge of these two concepts.

Unfortunately, people can enter advertising and marketing careers without ever knowing what an idea is, how to define what the word “idea” means, how to have ideas, or how to explain an idea once they have one in hand. Some people can sustain a long career through the brute force of their personality alone and by playing a game of, “Well, if we all don’t know then who’s to know?”

If you do creative work or have a creative soul, then ideas are your oxygen. This article just wants you to breathe. In it, I cover:

* The differences between ideas and thoughts

* The types of ideas we encounter in advertising

* How strategy and ideas work together and how they’re different

* Simple techniques to help you explain an idea

This article goes great with [How to do account planning - a simple approach](/how-to-do-account-planning-a-simple-approach/). If you do creative work, these two articles will catch you up to speed with concepts that took many years for many of us to comprehend.

## What’s an idea?

Words often get in the way of creativity so it’s no surprise that the word “idea” often gets in the way of ideas.

**1. We use the word “idea” to describe thoughts and suggestions -** “I know this is heteronormative of me but I have an idea: let’s eat kimchi soondubu at Food Gallery 32 in Koreatown for lunch.”

**2. We use the word “idea” to describe new concepts -** “I have an idea  —  it’s a business where we turn memes into bath products .  [Dank Tank](https://www.danktank.co/).”

**3. We use the word “idea” when someone says something stupid -** “You have no idea.” That’s a mean use of the word. Don’t be mean. The world doesn’t need it.

Now, if we focus on the first two examples, the word “idea” telegraphs that something new is coming. And if you can pause on your Internet memes about whether anything is ever new ( I’ll raise you post-modernism and ask if anything is ever real), what we now want to do is distinguish between the way we use “idea” as industry jargon and the way we use “idea” where we’re in casual mode.

**Ideas are thoughts but not all thoughts are “ideas”**

Here’s an example of the use of the word “idea” in an agency setting:
“I have an idea — let’s do something with augmented reality or Blockchain or make a special lens.” This isn’t wrong; it’s just sloppy.

In the traditional industry sense, “idea” means a novel concept. But when it’s used as in this example, it masks the lack of an actual idea  —  like when someone dumps in the word “strategic” before they say something that’s not strategic. It ups the importance of what comes next. The problem: sometimes this (as a meeting tactic) works but does not lead to good or clear thinking.

Compare this thought with the use of the word “idea” as a novel concept: “I have an idea  —  I want to create a tool that runners can use to track how far they’ve run and then compete with each other by sharing their achievements via the Internet. They’ll track it via this technology in their shoe which will talk to their computer.

**“Idea” and thought feel different**
When I’m training people in lateral thinking, I point out how adding mischief feels different in the brain. However, see how the two “I have an idea” statements above feel different? One is a yawn, the other a kick in the pants.

Yes, it’s complicated because humans complicate things. And what complicates all of this is that, as far as “ideas as novel concepts” go, in agency world, there are:

* Business ideas

* Advertising ideas

* Brand ideas

* Campaign ideas

* Content ideas

* New product ideas

Oh, and strategies (which are also ideas  —  even though the monopoly on the use of the word “idea” in an agency typically belongs to the creative department).

Perhaps, we need a different vocabulary to eliminate confusion and buffering or we simply need to define our words in public so we all know what we mean when we use them.

\##Why do you need to be able to explain an idea?

Here’s a secret: many people in our industry aren’t idea-literate. You could work with a creative team that focuses on taglines, hashtags, and manifestos. You might need to play the mind game of helping them articulate their idea without them knowing. You could work with other agencies who throw the word around like confetti only to catch yourself a few weeks into a project wondering, “What are we even talking about?”

It’s important to pry apart the executional stuff, the tactics from the idea for five reasons:

**1. Longevity**
If someone can’t explain their idea then they may be using verbal and visual tricks to get through an executional approach (eg a certain art style or piece of technology). This can reduce the longevity of a campaign/project because an execution may only carry interest for so long.

**2. Support and defensibility**
To defend great work that’s strategically based, there needs to be a clear line from the challenge through to the insight, strategy, and to the creative. A well-explained idea can help the team promote the work to the client. It also helps manage the conversation with the client so that executional concerns do not undermine the idea or the strategy. I have seen occasions where executional issues have led to a strategy change because neither the idea nor strategy were well explained.

**3. It’s more efficient  —  money money money**
If you can’t put stakes in the ground from problem to insight to strategy to idea and something executional gets rejected then DOMINOES! Re-work. More time, more money, more frustration. It will cost you.

**4. Brain tether**
If the thinking is executional (“I want to do 3D typography”) then it becomes harder to ensure every chapter across every channel builds on it without it all merely being matching luggage.

**5. Laziness is contagious**
It isn’t hard to define an idea — if you have one. Where projects don’t start with clear, concrete strategy and ideas, they are more likely to travel sloppy.

## Where strategy is distinct from the idea

With my former Creative Director, Vince McSweeney who’s now CCO at McCann Birmingham, we came to an agreement that strategy should be about finding insights and then flipping them so that the key output of the strategy is an idea that will get someone to see themselves, the world around them, the product, or the brand differently. It was then the creative job to take this flip and bring it to life in an impactful way. You can read [How to do account planning](/how-to-do-account-planning-a-simple-approach/) for more on this.

First, the context of this agreement was advertising but it relates to non-advertising work. Second, you know what’s most important about that agreement? That we discussed each other’s point of view, what we wanted to accomplish, and that we agreed. Most agencies  —  especially with a younger workforce  —  avoid this discussion. People don’t want noses out of whack. Creative teams can find a planner who brings a “flip” to them intimidating because they wonder what their role is but their role is to flip it even further. What a great role.

## An old example  —  Australia’s largest telco and the Great Wall of China

Perhaps you’ve seen the old Telstra Bigpond campaign where the father talks about the Great Wall of China being built by Emperor Nasi Goreng to keep the rabbits out?

The insight here taps into parents’ fears of the future leaving behind their children and the strategy aims to shift the broadband discussion in the home from technology and not needing it to education and, it implies, adult success.

The ad then brings this to life (although this example is quite executional; the “big idea” is in the strategy).

Some agencies keep the planner in the obvious. Words like “easy”, “performance”, “authenticity” or “confidence” are common in some briefs. This is not planning  —  but it happens either because that’s what planning is supposed to do in the agency or because creatives can feel insecure about having part of the problem solved for them (“That’s my job”  —  it’s been said to me). Everywhere is different though.

So, the strategic process is about understanding the issues, the environment, the customers, the insights and then creating an idea about how to shift perspectives. The creative process either solves the problem directly (a non-advertising solution first) or dramatizes the insight and perspective shift.

And… TALK TO EACHOTHER. Define these words and how you work together. Same team, yeah?

## What types of ideas are there?

These are the common types of ideas bouncing around a creative agency:

* **Business idea - ** what the company does that’s novel

* **Brand idea - ** what the company stands for that’s novel

* **Brand tagline - ** a short phrase that brings to life what the company stands for

* **Advertising idea - ** the central thought in every communication and interaction across all campaigns indefinitely

* **Campaign idea - ** if the advertising idea and campaign idea are separate then the campaign idea would typically be a subset and shorter-term execution of the advertising idea

* **Content idea - ** jargon for stuff that isn’t an ad

* **Non-advertising idea - ** a concept that solves a problem but that isn’t advertising-centric — it may, however, get advertised

* **Execution - ** the key bits of the execution that matter (style, channels, etc)

This list... it’s too much and it’s barely scratching the surface and the surface isn’t wearing protection. However, without a clear and agreed definition of what we’re talking about, it’s hard to work, and you can find yourself in meetings having conversations that go nowhere. Mind you, apparently, this is an excellent business model so what do I know?

## Examples - applying idea types to real-world companies

Let’s take [WWF](http://www.wwf.org.au/) and their [Earth Hour campaign](http://www.earthhour.org/). Now, this is my take on things — done quickly.

Business idea: protect the environment from humans\
Brand idea: keep the planet alive\
Brand tagline: “For a living planet”\
Advertising idea: I’m not sure there is a macro advertising idea for WWF (the panda isn’t one)\
Non-advertising idea: Earth Hour — get the world to turn its lights off for an hour\
Campaign idea: Vote Earth — a populist vote about the importance of climate change measured by the numbers of lights switched off (2010)\
Execution: Shepard Fairey street posters as a rallying call\
 \
Old Spice — again, my interpretation (probably riddled with holes):\
Business idea: make men smell classically masculine (not stinky)\
Brand idea: the authentic essence of man (I can’t remember the actual phrase but I read it was something like that)\
Brand tagline: The man your man could smell like\
Advertising idea: Old Spice guy — the man you wish you were. This would only be their advertising idea if it’s repeated across different campaigns.\
Non-advertising idea: N/A\
Campaign idea: The set-change\
Execution: The Old Spice guy walks through sets innocently pulling off incredible feats of manliness, boldly telling you about them as he does them\
 \
If Old Spice’s business idea is to make men smell classically masculine (I made it up), then this idea gives them the opportunity to stretch into other areas. It anchors them in a core idea but allows them to explore further adrift.
