Stephen Troncoso ([@Ephen_Stephen](https://twitter.com/Ephen_Stephen)) asks:
> Many people with an English (academic) background go into strategy. Same with English cultural backgrounds. Is this a coincidence? 

Answer: No, that’s how it works.

But, here's a stab at asking the question behind this question, which is probably this: What's up with all the English in American planning?

If you're new to planning, you might want to also read [How to do account planning - a simple approach](https://www.markpollard.net/how-to-do-account-planning-a-simple-approach/).

And, I'd recommend you listen to this Sweathead interview with Ben Shaw - [Strategy Work Is Creative Work](https://anchor.fm/sweathead-with-mark-pollard/episodes/Strategy-Work-Is-Creative-Work---Ben-Shaw--Strategy-Head-e5aoqp). Ben runs strategy at BBH London and discusses how the agency is changing how it recruits.

**1. The English advertising industry has a prestigious DNA
**The London advertising industry has recruited heavily from Oxford and Cambridge over the years (I’m told). These colleges have a history of recruiting for intelligence and background. To study the liberal arts is something of an “elite” idea because such study might or might not lead to a financially successful career. And so English people with great upbringings and elite education have played a huge role in English agencies. Advertising is something of a national interest - but a national interest with a prestigious history.

**2. London culture is creative and intellectual**
You just need to walk the streets of London to see and hear banter. The storefront signage, conversations in front of pubs, the types of debates on television. There’s a lot of verbal jousting. Yes, there are swathes of people outside of London in advertising. I’ve heard that many people have struggled to have the elite parts of the London agency world take them seriously (accents, looks, educational pedigree). But London has been such a heartland for the global advertising agency culture that I’m focusing on it. And it just feels that ideas and intellect are more mainstream. London has a massive creative industry population, too.

These two points mean that planning has a tradition of recruiting intelligent, high-performing, and, sometimes, elite individuals. There’s power in it.

**3. The US has a history of anti-intellectualism**
If you look at the history of the US mind, there has been a lot of anti-intellectualism. “That’s what the elites do to take advantage of us.” Faris Yakob has written about this and cited many sources.

**4. The English made and exported planning**
Planning originated in London. England exported the idea and many of its planners to agencies around the world. They brought a sense of history and credibility with them.

**5. Other career options aren’t always interesting or available
**I feel this more about Australia compared to the US than England compared to the US. If I had grown up in America and had similar-enough experiences, I don’t know if I’d have ended up in advertising. There are just so many other choices here - a bigger quantity of industries and a bigger number of ways to specialize. If the UK is more like Australia than America, then, again, this affects recruitment. Advertising isn't just a legitimate choice, it's one of fewer choices.   

**6. The US has an inferiority complex when it comes to the intellect**
Americans are known for confidence. Yes, over-confidence, too. But I’ve heard tens of times that having a British accent (or an Australian accent that people think is British) means that people think you’re smarter than they are.

Tom Goodwin talks about the premium he believes the New York dating world places on a British accent in [an episode of Sweathead here](https://anchor.fm/sweathead-with-mark-pollard/episodes/Some-Form-Of-Sunshine---Tom-Goodwin-e6f76d). Also, [take a look at Dolly May's website](https://www.workingwithvoice.com). She provides "accent softening services" for people who move to London because of the challenges people in England also face when they move to the country's headquarters. 

The idea of a “classically trained” planner is another idea that plays on American advertising minds. I still don’t know what this means. I think being classically trained means you’ve worked in a well-known agency under a well-known boss and done planning on well-known brands for at least three years. Right? The word “classically” sounds like an English tic so I'd imagine an elitist planner lobbed that one into American advertising. And, to me, it hints to the classics, which is another way to signal prestige in background and education.

I can understand the inferiority complex only through the very first point - that many English advertising people have been upper class and have had amazing educational backgrounds. Also, many are hard-working, irreverent, and ambitious. I don’t want to diminish anyone. Intelligence and high conscientiousness tend to lead to good life outcomes. I heard it somewhere.

**7. It isn’t easy to migrate - it takes clout**
Sure, people move around the world in all kinds of ways but to get a visa in our industry, it helps for the above to be true: good education and great salary. Many visas require this. This means that the visa process selects for people who’ve done well and often people who’ve done are gifted with innate traits and abilities but they also often have advantages others don’t. Seeing people like you in a role and proximity to opportunity are key. Again, I’m not diminishing. I’m just making a point that I think people who comets the industry here are often - not always - quite successful or ambitious. 

**8. Studying English is studying humanity**
Then we get into the double-entendre of “What’s up with all the English people in American planning roles?”

Literature is studying people and trying to make sense of the world. It’s deeply psychological. It deals in ideas. These are at the heart of planning.
