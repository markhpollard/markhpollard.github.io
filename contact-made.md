There’s something satisfying about pushing a button. When pushing a button works, power rushes through the body to the brain and whooshes the brain into a state of glee and giddiness and invincibility.

Pushing a human’s buttons is a whole other thing. Please do not do this unless the buttons lead to laughter and hugs.

I’ll read your email soon. If it was good.

Now, go lead that sick strategy life or read something:
- [How to do Account Planning](how-to-do-account-planning-a-simple-approach/)
- [How to Explain Ideas](how-to-explain-an-idea/)


Or come hang on the Internet - [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/markpollard), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/markpollard), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/2559165/).

I hope all these choices didn’t paralyze you.
