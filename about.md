Once upon a time, I lived at least two lives. At the age of 19, I started work in the agency world. This was also the same age I started work on what became Australia’s first full-color hip hop magazine. By day, it was business, and, at all other times, it was hip hop. I didn’t really talk about the hip hop world at work because that was an era when people ridiculed it. Ten years later, they’d go to the festivals headlined by hip hop artists.

In the agency world, I started as a digital producer, where a digital producer managed the projects, billing, clients, functional specifications, information architecture, wireframes, analytics, and often wrote the copy. I don’t think I met a digital strategist until a few years into my career. They didn’t exist. 

I loved the Internet. It was so immediate, you could skirt around gatekeepers, and it didn’t cost much - if anything - to put something out there. And, with hip hop, what I loved was its commitment to two things: raw expression and action. If you wanted to do something, you just did something, and when you did it, there weren’t many places to hide. 

These dynamics of the Internet and hip hop were real to me. But, as I navigated bigger agencies and into what some people call more traditional agencies and morphed into a planner, I was intrigued by how it all worked on one hand and frustrated by any semblance of hierarchy, process that slowed things down, or thinking that hid in nonsense frameworks and IP on the other hand. 

In the last couple of years of my twenties, a few things happened. My wife and I had two children, I moved into my first strategy-only role at Leo Burnett under [Todd Sampson](http://toddsampson.com.au/), Wall Street crashed, Twitter launched, and I met [Julian Cole](https://twitter.com/juliancole). As the recession hit and my clients’ offices emptied out, as more social media conferences featured social media gurus who’d never done anything on the Internet, and as I saw the mischief that Julian Cole brought to bear on his blog, I decided to see what it felt like to “be that guy” - the one I was avoiding, the one who wrote about strategy. I wrote [7 things hip hop taught me about community](http://adspace-pioneers.blogspot.com/2008/12/7-things-hip-hop-taught-me-about.html) for Julian’s blog in 2008, people read it, so I kept writing and launched this website at the start of 2009.

I write to work out what I think, to keep myself company, to find my people, and because I really love it. I teach and train people because I know the power of these ways of thinking and the beauty of this career even though I also know the industry is tough, riddled with mental health challenges, assholes, and burnout. Helping people think is my life’s work and it currently happens through the theme of strategy but that is never what it’s really about. And I do strategy because when I work closely with clients, I'm often not just solving a business issue - I'm helping them understand themselves better and then put that new understanding out into the world with fireworks.  And this is what I do at Mighty Jungle in New York City.
