## Ideas are your oxygen

If you studied accounting, you’d leave your first week knowing what the concepts “debit” and “credit” are. And, if you entered the career of accounting, you could only do so with intimate knowledge of these two concepts. Unfortunately, people can enter an advertising or marketing career without ever knowing what an idea is, how to define what the word “idea” means, how to have ideas, or to explain an idea once they have one in hand. Some people can sustain a long career through the brute force of their personality alone and by playing a game of, “Well, if we all don’t know then who’s to know?”

If you do creative work or have a creative soul, then ideas are your oxygen. This article just wants you to breathe. In it, I cover:
* The differences between ideas and thoughts
* The types of ideas we encounter in advertising
* How strategy and ideas work together and how they’re different
* Simple techniques to help you explain an idea

This article goes great with [How to do account planning - a simple approach](/how-to-do-account-planning-a-simple-approach/). If you do creative work, these two articles will catch you up to speed with concepts that took many years for many of us to comprehend.
